THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:

Whenever you want to run your code in your sql file you need to use "source". But you must be in the database.
EX: source file_name.sql;
    source select_exercises.sql;
    source albums_seeder.sql;

Spaces count when you are writing scripts in MySQL.

When working with a number value it does not matter if the value is in quotes.
EX: SELECT record_name FROM albums WHERE release_date = 1990;
                              ||
    SELECT record_name FROM albums WHERE release_date = '1990';
